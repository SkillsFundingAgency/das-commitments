# Jinja version of GOV.UK template

This repository is the [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) version of the [govuk_template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template).

It can also be used with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), a Javascript templating language based on Jinja.

It's published to the [npm Registry](https://www.npmjs.org/package/govuk_template_jinja) and you can add it to your application's dependencies from there.
