This folder contains a temporary implementation of the **IHashingService** copied from SFA.DAS.Hashing.

The available nugets for that package are all .NET Framework. The PR **https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-shared-packages/pull/289** has converted the sln top .net standard but this cannot be merged to master until devops have upgraded the build pipeline.

When a NetStandard version of the hashing service is available then this folder (Temp) can be deleted and the HashIds nuget package removed.
